**Rescue AI - Human Detection and Resource Estimation Using TensorFlow Lite**

This project is an advanced AI-based application that uses TensorFlow Lite for detecting humans in real-time through the device's camera. It estimates the number of people detected and provides essential resource calculations needed for rescue missions, such as water, food, shelter, and medical kits. Designed for quick deployment in disaster zones and emergency situations, Rescue AI can aid in efficient resource planning and management.
